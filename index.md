excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am currently an Associate Bioinformatics Principal Investigator with the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC). My work focuses on microbial genomics, bioinformatics, and forensics.

Formerly, I was a Computational Biologist with the [Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/bioinformatics-computational-biosciences-branch) (BCBB) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and was involved in teaching university courses in evolutionary genetics and bioinformatics through the NIAID African Centers of Excellence program. Prior to that, I was an [NIH/NHGRI - Genome Sciences Training Program](https://www.genome.gov/careers-training/NHGRI-Funding-Opportunities-Training-Career-Development/Locations) Postdoctoral Fellow and Michael Guyer Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://gstp.wisc.edu/) working with [Prof. Carol Lee](https://carollee.labs.wisc.edu/Lee.html). I obtained a PhD in Biological Sciences from the George Washington University, [Computational Biology Institute](https://cbi.gwu.edu/) working with Prof. Keith Crandall.

My graduate and postdoctoral research studied parallel and convergent evolution to understand evolutionary and genetic mechanisms producing the diversity of traits and species we observe in nature. By focusing on replicated evolutionary events, one can find general answers to biological questions, increase power to detect important patterns, and assess the predictability of evolutionary change. Studying natural, laboratory, and simulated populations, I used a combination of population and comparative genomic tools to answer questions about evolutionary genetic processes producing phenotypic and molecular diversity. I often used phylogenetic frameworks to detect convergent evolution at various levels and test evolutionary hypothesis using phylogenetic models.
